# ARACHNE CENTRAL API / DARWIN EU FORK

*This is the Arachne Central Fork of the Darwin EU CC, it contains modifications required for the DARWIN EU CC
The original readme is available in this folder*

## HOW TO RUN

Check the original readme, for ease of use SOLR can be set up locally with the Dockerfile in solr_config folder

## HOW TO DEPLOY

When committing changes to the master branch a build and release is triggered in Azure DevOps to the dev environment.
It uses the Dockerfile present here for the build, to make life easy (for now) we place the UI, API and Solr together
in a single image.
